## Branch naming convention

To maintain consistency and clarity in our development workflow, we follow a structured branch naming convention. Below are the guidelines for naming branches in this repository.  

### Format  

<type>/<author_initials>/<ticket_number>-<short_description>

### Components  

1. **Type** – Defines the purpose of the branch. Examples:  
   - `bugfix` – Fixing a bug  
   - `feature` – Implementing a new feature  
   - `chore` – Maintenance tasks like refactoring or documentation updates  

2. **Author Initials** – The initials of the developer working on the branch. Example: `nd`.  

3. **Ticket Number** – The issue or ticket ID from the tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues).  

4. **Short Description** – A brief and meaningful description of the work being done, separated by hyphens (`-`). Keep it concise and lowercase.  

## Examples  

- `bugfix/nd/1234-fix-login-error` – Fixing a login issue.  
- `feature/jd/5678-add-user-profile-page` – Adding a new user profile page.  
- `chore/xy/3142-update-dependencies` – Updating project dependencies.
